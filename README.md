# planning_machine
A mobile version of the student planning machine created by ahoereht. Android only for now.


# Compile & Install
The project was done in AndroidStudio. Easiest way is probably to import it there. (AndroidStudio: checkout from VCS).
From there you can build and install it on your andorid phone or emulator.
It should work on all Android phones running >5.0
